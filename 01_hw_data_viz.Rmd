
The factors that identified are the country and the continent 






\newpage

## Question 2 (10 points)

Let's investigate how life expectancy varies across the continents. Using `ggplot`, we want you to recreate the following figure:

![](figures/life_exp_boxplot.png)

These are boxplots of the distribution of life expectancy in each continent. Please make sure that you include the labels as shown in this figure. For the autograder to be able to process your plot, you should assign your the output of your `ggplot` call to `plot_q2` and then evaluate `plot_q2` to ensure that the plot is produced in the output. That is, your code should look like this:

```{r}
plot_q2 <-
  ggplot()
  ggplot(<arguments>) +
  geom_<type>(<arguments>) +
  ...

plot_q2
```


  **Note:** in the raw Rmd file for this problem set, you'll notice the above code chunk has the argument `eval = FALSE`. This tells Rmarkdown not to try to run the code, since it's not complete. If you copy and paste this chunk below, be sure to remove that argument to ensure the code runs properly. 

  **Rubric**: 10 autograder points. 

## Answer 2

```{r}
plot_q2 <- ggplot( data = gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Continent", 
       y = "Life Expectancy (years)", 
       title = "Life Expectancy by Continent")

plot_q2

```




\newpage

## Question 3 (5 points)

Looking at the previous plot, which continent has the highest median life expectancy? Which part of the boxplot can we determine this from?

 **Rubric**: 5 write up points (2 for identifying the correct continent, 3 for correctly identifying how to find this on the boxplot)

## Answer 3

The continent with the highest median life expectancy is Oceania.

On the boxplot, the median is represented by the thick horizental black line inside each continent's box. Oceania's median line is higher than any of the other continents.



\newpage

## Question 4 (15 points)

The previous boxplot groups all the years together into one boxplot, but what if we want to understand how life expectancy is changing over time? Next, we will recreate the following plot: 

![](figures/life_exp_facet.png)

The plot shows each country's life expectancy trajectory over time, broken out by continent with smoothed average lines overlayed for each continent. To get started, we'll give you a few clues about what we've done here:

- The lines for each country use the color `"gray70"`. 
- The `linewidth` of the smoothed line is 1.1 and the method used is the loess smoother. We also have turned off the standard errors. 
- Make sure that the facets are all on one row. Look at the [`facet_wrap`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_wrap.html) documentation if need help with this. 
- Make sure that the labels are correctly specified. 
- Use the chunk options `fig.width = 11` and `fig.height = 4` to shrink the font size so the year labels will not overlap. 

Finally, assign the output of your `ggplot` call to `plot_q4` and then evaluate `plot_q4` (similarly to what you did in Question 2). 

 **Rubric**: 15 autograder points. 


## Answer 4

```{r, fig.width = 11. fig.height = 4}

plot_q4 <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = country), color = "gray70") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1.1) +
  facet_wrap(~continent, nrow = 1) +
  labs(x = "year", y = "Life Expectancy", title = "Life Expectancy tranjectories by Continent")

plot_q4

```

## Question 5 (AI disclosure statement)

Please explain whether you used AI for this assignment. If yes, describe exactly how you used it. 

As a reminder, if your code appears to be simply generated by giving the assignment (or individual questions) to an LLM and asking for a complete solution, the entire problem set will be graded with 0 points.

Using AI to ask clarification questions or to get help with mistakes and errors when you are stuck is completely fine, as long as you clearly disclose it.

Please write your answer below.

## Answer 5


Yes, I used a little bit of AI for this assignment. If i were to get stuck writing code, and it kept showing me an error, I would help it point out my mistake. However, I would only do this if I was really stuck
